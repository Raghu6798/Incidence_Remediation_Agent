For a comprehensive incident response DevOps agent, here are the key tool categories you're missing after GitHub and CLI:
Monitoring & Observability

Prometheus/Grafana tools - Query metrics, create/update alerts
DataDog/New Relic API tools - Check service health, query logs
PagerDuty integration - Create/resolve incidents, manage escalations
CloudWatch tools (if AWS) - Query logs, metrics, create alarms

Infrastructure Management

Kubernetes tools - Pod scaling, service management, cluster operations
Docker tools - Container management, image operations
Cloud provider APIs (AWS/GCP/Azure) - Instance management, networking changes
Load balancer tools - Traffic routing, health checks

Communication & Coordination

Slack/Teams tools - Status updates, stakeholder notifications
Email/SMS tools - Alert broadcasting
Incident management - Jira/ServiceNow integration for ticket creation

Security & Access

Vault/Secrets management - Credential rotation during incidents
Certificate tools - SSL/TLS certificate management
Firewall/Security group tools - Network isolation, access control

Database Operations

Database connection tools - Health checks, failover operations
Backup/restore tools - Data recovery operations
Query execution - Diagnostic queries, data validation

Most Critical for Incident Response:

Monitoring integration (Prometheus/DataDog) - You need to detect and assess issues
Kubernetes tools - Modern apps likely run on K8s
Notification tools (Slack/PagerDuty) - Keep humans in the loop
Cloud provider APIs - For infrastructure changes

Which of these areas are most relevant to your incident response scenarios? I can help you implement the specific tools that would be most valuable for your use cases.
